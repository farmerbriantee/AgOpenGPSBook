# START HERE

## Before we get started tho..

If you're reading this in the github repository, you should know that it looks a LOT nicer if you visit it in gitbook - here: [https://agopengps.gitbook.io/agopengps/](https://agopengps.gitbook.io/agopengps/)

### All good?

OK, on with the show. You're here because you either a) went down a rabbit hole and got lost, or b) are interested in AgOpenGPS - a free (as in beer) open-source system to auto-steer your machinery. "What?", you cry? "A free system!! I pay tens of thousands for that!!!".

Yeah... about that....

First off, AgOpenGPS is available here:

The following sections - which are very much a work in progress - may help you decide if AOG is for you (short answer: it is!), and how difficult it might be to achieve (short answer: nowhere near as difficult as you'd think!).

We'll try and take you through the ordering process, assembly, configuration, and even a user's manual.

Well, when we get the energy - I ate a lot at xmas. Plough on for more info (and poor farming puns).

You can search at the top of the page, open the 3-bar menu for more sections, or just hit that right arrow below and work your way through...

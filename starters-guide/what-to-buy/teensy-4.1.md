# Teensy 4.1

The brains of the AOG board is the Teensy 4.1, and these are a little hard to find. You want to make sure you get one that DOES have ethernet tho, as it is also available without. Do not buy a Teensy 3.2, or a 4.0.. you want 4.1.

A good place to start your hunt is here: [https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

Make sure the one you order has the chip highlighted in red - that's ethernet.

Also, you'll need some long 2mm pitch headers to solder to the board for it to reach to connector on your PCB. Get the board itself with pins if you want to skip the soldering, but the soldering is pretty easy.

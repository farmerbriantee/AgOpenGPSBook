# Tablet

You want a tablet that's rugged and has a screen that won't be impaired in direct sunlight. The Panasonic Toughpad range can be bought very cheaply, refurbished, on ebay.

Look for one with at least 8gb memory, preferably an SSD hard drive and if you can find one with built-in ethernet all the better (otherwise you'll need a USB dongle to connect it to the AOG board). Ideally, an HD screen (1920x1080) would be good, but the standard 1366x768 is still OK for AOG.

Make sure it has wifi for tethering to your phone, or USB for a hard-tether if not (preferably not of course).

#### MOST IMPORTANTLY - it must be a WINDOWS tablet. Android will NOT work. The version of Windows isn't important, 10 or 11 will be fine.

Make sure you get a charger, and you may need to go looking for a 12V charger as well of course (unless your machine has a 110/240V inverter?). If you find the right seller, you can even claim the VAT back.

Models of note:

* CF-D1
* GZ-G1
* FZ-M1

Models to STAY AWAY FROM

* FZ-A1 (android, no use!)

# Wheel Angle Sensor

It's the job of the wheel angle sensor to tell AOG which direction the wheels are pointing. If you already have one on your machine, you might find you can use it instead. Check out the Discourse forum for more on that. If you can't use it, or there isn't one, you can use one of these to provide the info to AOG. Having wheel direction information (no matter how it's provided) is critical, you can't skip this.

Land Rover suspension height sensors are popular here and they're pretty cheap brand new on ebay.

You should also get a wiring harness plug for it:

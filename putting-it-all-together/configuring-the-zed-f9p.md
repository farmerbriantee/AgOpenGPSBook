# Configuring the ZED-F9P

### How to configure your ZED-F9P

When you receive your GPS controllers, they'll have a basic configuration on it - but it's likely not optimal for what AgOpenGPS needs. What they need is their own configuration file uploaded.

The choice of file will depend on whether you're going for single or dual GPS.

You'll find the files in your AgOpenGPS Support/UBloxF9PConfigurations folder, but you can also get them here:

The first thing we'll do is update them to firmware 3.2. For this, you'll either be using a micro USB cable to the AOG board (with the chip inserted but the board powered OFF) if you have the Micro board, to each chip in turn. If you're using the standard board, you can just USB it onto your PC without the AOG board.

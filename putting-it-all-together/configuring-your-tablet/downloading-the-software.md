# Downloading the software

The latest version - or "release" - of AgOpenGPS is always available here. At time of writing, that's 5.6.35, and you'll be downloading the large ZIP file.

Click the ZIP file and save it to your computer. Pay attention to where you saved it - usually your Downloads folder - and then go find it in Windows Explorer. Right-click on it and select Properties, and then tick the Unblock box and select OK.

Once you've done that, right-click it again and select Extract All (your other menu options will likely be different):

Pick a location and extract. Up to you where to put them, but if you're unsure, you might wish to put them on your desktop:

Once that's done, you can double-click the AgOpenGPS icon to run it:

Be aware - if you move that icon to the top level of your desktop, then it will lose the location of the rest of your files and fail to start (without any error). If you want a shortcut on your desktop, right-click it and do Send To, Desktop (Create shortcut):

# Swapping GPS ports

If you connected your Teensy up over USB and are monitoring its output, you might see this message - "Swapping GPS ports".

This indicates that for whatever reason, the Teensy and your U-blox modules are unable to communicate. Check the connections on the board are good, and that the F9Ps are well settled in the sockets.

# Help! I need to speak to someone!

Before you look for help either on Discourse, please check this book itself, the information here will be kept as up to date as possible. It's under construction, but in time, it should hopefully become the go-to resource for all issues.

In other words.. the problem you're having has likely been encountered by someone already, so it could be in the FAQ section or the "Problems and Solution" section. There's a search at the top too.

If you're really stuck, or just fancy a chat, then there's a great community of people willing to help you, You can join the Discourse forum below, but before we get into that:

### How to ask for help

If you do need to ask for help, make your question as descriptive as possible. Remember, most people's equipment and experiences are different, so assuming "someone will just know what I mean" can lead to frustration and put people off getting involved. Samples ensue...

The wrong way to ask for help

* I built my board and it's not working, help!!
* I turned it on and there's a red light, am not sure what to check
* I wired it all up, and the tractor isn't steering

The right way

* I built the new Micro all-in-one board, it was assembled at JLCPCB. The following components were missing (list them). I've followed the wiring guide and believe it to be correct. When I plug it in to 12V, the green light illuminates, but when I press the MA button on the Cytron, the motor doesn't turn the steering wheel, but my multimeter shows 12V out on the Cytron. AgOpenGPS is detecting the board, but it won't steer the tractor. Here's a photo of my board, can anyone advise?

Remember, when asking for help, there's no such thing as "too much information". But there sure is "too little!".
